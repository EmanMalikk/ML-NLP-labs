# ML-NLP-labs
This repository contains my foundational Machine Learning and NLP lab work. It includes data analysis with Pandas/NumPy, scikit-learn classifiers, model evaluation (train–test split, cross-validation), and core NLP preprocessing tasks like tokenization, stopword removal, and wordcloud generation etc.
